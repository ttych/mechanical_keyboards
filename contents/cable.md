## Cables

Connector Type, Quality, Sheath

----------

## Connector Type

- Mostly Mini USB 2.0
- New usage of USB 3.1 Type-C

----------

## Cable Quality

- AWG : American Wire Gauge

> the lower the gauge - the higher the thickness.

To reduce resistance and allow for a better flow of electrons the diameter of the cable's conductor must be increased. By doing so, resistance is automatically reduced over the cable.

----------

## Sheath

- polyethylene (PE)
- polychlorure de vinyle (PVC)
- Nylon
